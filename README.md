I created a simple website in Laravel to explore Laravel 10. I chose a webshop theme, with that I can try different parts of Laravel 10.

The following parts are included in the website:
- Authentication with Laravel Breeze.
- Models with Eloquent Relationships
- Database seeding with Factories
- Roles & permissions system (Laratrust)
- Controllers for each Model
- Views with Tailwind CSS
